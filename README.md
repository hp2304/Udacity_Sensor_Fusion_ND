# Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Projects

Below are the projects and exercises I completed while pursuing the Udacity's [Sensor Fusion Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/sensor-fusion-engineer-nanodegree--nd313).

1. [Lidar Obstacle Detection](./SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/)
2. [Camera Module Exercises](./SFND_Camera/)
3. [Camera Keypoint Tracking](./SFND_2D_Feature_Tracking/)
4. [3D Object Tracking by Fusing Knowledge Gained from Lidar & Camera ](./SFND_3D_Object_Tracking/)
5. [Radar Target Detection](./SFND_Radar_Target_Detection/)
6. [Unscented Kalman Filter Exercises](./SFND_UKF_Exercises/)
7. [Unscented Kalman Filter for Obstacle State Estimation](./SFND_Unscented_Kalman_Filter/)
