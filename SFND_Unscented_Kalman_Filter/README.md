# SFND Unscented Kalman Filter

#### Note

- Added basic config parser (same as older projects)
- NIS calculated for [Radar](radar_nis.txt) and [Lidar](lidar_nis.txt). 
Approximately 9% of the values are greater than 7.8 (3 DOF and 5% value, Chi-squared Distribution) for Radar.
Approximately 6% of the values are greater than 5.99 (2 DOF and 5% value, Chi-squared Distribution) for Lidar.

- Current set of configs works without failing project requirements.
